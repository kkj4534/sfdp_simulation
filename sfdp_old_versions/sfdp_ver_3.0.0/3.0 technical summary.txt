# SFDP Enhanced Physics Implementation - Technical Summary

## Overview

The enhanced SFDP (Spiral Feed mark Diamond Pattern) simulation framework represents a complete refactoring from empirical models to physics-based approaches. This implementation addresses all the critical issues identified in the original code and provides validated, accurate predictions of machining behavior.

## Key Physics Models Implemented

### 1. Temperature-Dependent Material Properties

Unlike the original static properties, all material properties now vary with temperature:

- **Thermal Conductivity**: k(T) = k₀ + k₁·T
- **Specific Heat**: cp(T) = cp₀ + cp₁·T  
- **Young's Modulus**: E(T) = E₀(1 - αE·(T-T₀))
- **Yield Strength**: σy(T) = σy₀(1 - αy·(T-T₀))

Validated against ASM Handbook data for Ti6Al4V, Al7075, and SS316L.

### 2. Johnson-Cook Constitutive Model

Full implementation of the Johnson-Cook flow stress model:

```
σ = [A + B·εⁿ][1 + C·ln(ε̇/ε̇₀)][1 - T*ᵐ]
```

Where:
- A, B, n = Strain hardening parameters
- C = Strain rate sensitivity
- m = Thermal softening exponent
- T* = Homologous temperature

This replaces the simple Kienzle model and captures:
- Strain hardening
- Strain rate effects
- Thermal softening

### 3. Merchant-Lee-Shaffer Shear Angle Theory

Cutting forces calculated using fundamental shear plane theory:

- **Merchant Model**: φ = π/4 - β/2 + γ/2
- **Lee-Shaffer Correction**: Applied for built-up edge conditions
- **Chip Morphology**: Predicts continuous, segmented, or saw-tooth chips based on strain rate and temperature

### 4. Usui Tool Wear Model

Multi-mechanism wear model including:

- **Diffusion Wear**: VḂ = A·σn·V·exp(-B/T)
- **Adhesion Wear**: Active at T < 400°C
- **Abrasion Wear**: Mechanical wear component
- **Oxidation Wear**: Active at T > 700°C

Each mechanism is temperature and stress dependent.

### 5. Advanced Thermal Analysis

- **ADI Method**: Alternating Direction Implicit for stability
- **Moving Heat Source**: Gaussian distribution following tool path
- **Temperature-Dependent Properties**: k(T), cp(T) updated each timestep
- **Cooling Models**: HTC varies with temperature and flow conditions

### 6. Chatter Stability with Regenerative Effect

- **Modal Analysis**: Natural frequency calculation from tool geometry
- **Stability Lobes**: Multiple lobes calculated using regenerative theory
- **Strategy Factor**: Accounts for varying engagement in spiral patterns

### 7. Physics-Based Surface Roughness

Surface roughness combines multiple components:

```
Ra_total = √(Ra_geom² + Ra_vibration² + Ra_wear²)
```

- **Geometric**: Feed marks from tool nose radius
- **Vibration**: Based on tool dynamics and stability
- **Wear**: Contribution from tool wear progression

### 8. Residual Stress Model

Comprehensive stress analysis including:

- **Thermal Stress**: From temperature gradients
- **Mechanical Stress**: From cutting forces (Hertzian contact)
- **Phase Transformation**: For titanium alloys above β-transus
